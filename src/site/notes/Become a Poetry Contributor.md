## About becoming a contributor
The Icarus Newsletter is a locally run, Grand Rapids based poetry newsletter that accepts poetry from anybody about (almost) everything! It doesn't matter if your 9 or 99, we would love to have you write for us. If you're apprehensive about publishing your work in our newsletter, I would like to assure you that we aren't a massive corporation that only takes the best poetry in the world. Our mission is to help people like you gain the confidence to get their poetry out there, regardless of skill level or experience. Even if you think it's garbage, we're still happy to review it and let you know what we think! We don't bite!

You might've noticed that we take (almost) everything. While we encourage people to explore difficult topics, we also strive to be as family friendly as we can. So to help you decide whether what you wrote is appropriate, here's some guidelines:
- Limited description of nudity
- No explicit sexual content
- No explicit gore (especially if there's not a point to it)
- No advocation for violence
- No hate towards a specific person or group of people (we don't mind political poetry, but please do not advocate for violence towards anybody)
- Limited usage of expletives (again, especially if there's not a point to it)
We reserve the right to deny poetry for any reason, including for breaking our guidelines. We strive to make our newsletter accessible to everyone! If you're not sure if your poetry breaks any of our guidelines, still feel free to send it in! We'll let you know what we think.

Oh and the best part of this all? Publishing with us is totally free!
