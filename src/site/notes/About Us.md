## Our Mission
We hope to be able to inspire the Grand Rapids poetry scene, of all ages, to get their works out in the world. We also want to encourage people to seek out local poetry and support the local community.

Hi y'all, my name is Miller and I run this newsletter! I'm a senior in high school, and I consider myself a jack of all trades. I write poetry, some prose, draw, world build and many other creative things! If you email us, you'll most likely reach me. Feel free to ask any questions!
