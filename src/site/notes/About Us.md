## Meet the Peeps
### Miller
Hi y'all, my name is Miller and I run this newsletter! I'm a senior in high school, and I consider myself a jack of all trades. I write poetry, some prose, draw, world build and many other creative things! If you email us, you'll most likely reach me. Feel free to ask any questions!
