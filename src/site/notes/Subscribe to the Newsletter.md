So you might not be interested in writing poetry, but can I interest you in reading some? Support your local poets and subscribe to our newsletter! We promise that we will not send you anything that you didn't sign up for, or sell your information. Right now we just have one newsletter, our monthly poetry one. On it you'll find a selection of poetry written by Grand Rapids poets, and occasionally some notes from us. It's totally free, and you can unsubscribe at any time!
